# Pareto Curves — DSR1 & DSV4 on GB300 NVL72 (GKE A4X Max)

Throughput-per-GPU Pareto curves for the three sweeps, in the style of the
[InferenceX inference dashboard](https://inferencex.semianalysis.com/inference):
**Ours** (GKE A4X Max measured) overlaid on **InferenceX published** GB300 numbers, with
three x-axis views per model — interactivity, E2E latency, and TTFT.

- Workload: 8k/1k (ISL 8192 / OSL 1024), random dataset, ignore-eos, disaggregated prefill/decode.
- **Y axis** is total (input + output) throughput per GPU: `(input tok/s + output tok/s) / total GPUs`.
- **Metrics are mean-derived** (interactivity = 1000 / mean TPOT; TTFT and E2E are means),
  matching the mean-to-mean convention in `compare_inferencex*.py`.
- Point selection follows the repo rules: `mult10` runs preferred where present, untuned
  primaries, NATS/TCP/kv-headroom A/B variants excluded.
- Figures regenerate from `results-summary/*.json` + `reference/*.csv`
  (see `reports/figures/`).

Percentages on GKE rows are the gap vs the InferenceMax published value for the same point: `(GKE − InferenceMax) / InferenceMax`. Positive means GKE is higher — better for throughput columns, worse for latency columns. Input/output tput are per prefill/decode GPU respectively; E2EL and ITL are medians in seconds.

## DeepSeek-R1 FP8

Points: `ll` 4P/4D (conc 4), `mid` 40P/32D (conc 128–1024). InferenceX additionally
publishes 48P/24D at conc 2048/4096, which we have not run.

## DeepSeek-V4-Pro FP4

Points: `p1`–`p8` replicating the published ladder (1 → 8192 concurrency). The dashed
hollow series is the parity-drift reruns of p5–p8 (labelled, not clean comparisons —
see `dsv4-sweep/compare_inferencex.py`). The clean p8 rerun is latency-only (no
throughput) and therefore appears only in the drift series on the chart.

Percentages on GKE rows are the gap vs the InferenceMax published value for the same point: `(GKE − InferenceMax) / InferenceMax`. Positive means GKE is higher — better for throughput columns, worse for latency columns. Input/output tput are per prefill/decode GPU respectively; E2EL and ITL are medians in seconds.
GKE p8 (conc 8192) is the latency-only clean rerun — no throughput numbers; concurrencies 8–64 (4P/24D) have no GKE run yet.

## Reading the curves

- On the interactivity view, up-and-right is better; on the latency views (log-x),
  up-and-left is better.
- The curves are connected scatters across topologies (as on the InferenceX dashboard),
  so segments between different P/D splits are visual guides, not operating points.
- Full per-point tables and deltas vs published live in the per-model reports:
  `benchmark-report-dsr1-8k1k.md`, `benchmark-report-dsr1-fp8-8k1k.md`,
  `benchmark-report-dsv4-8k1k.md`.
